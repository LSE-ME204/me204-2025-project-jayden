## Introduction

This project, which I completed for [ME204](https://lse-dsi.github.io/ME204/2025/), explores a simple but important question:  
**Why isn't the United States one of the happiest countries in the world, despite being one of the richest?**

Using seven years of global survey data from the World Happiness Reports, and socio-economic indicators from the World Bank API, I built a data pipeline to uncover what really explains national happiness. The U.S. consistently underperforms in global happiness rankings, and this project investigates why.

## Methodology & Justification

To answer this question, I merged two global datasets:

::: {.callout-tip title="Data Sources"}
- **World Bank API** — Economic and governance indicators  
- **World Happiness Reports** — Happiness scores, rankings, and drivers
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="World Bank Variables"}
- GDP_Current_USD  
- Health_Expenditure_percent_GDP  
- Education_Expenditure_percent_GDP  
- Unemployment_Rate_percent  
- Inflation_Annual_percent  
- FDI_Net_Inflows_percent_GDP  
- Population_Total  
- Life_Expectancy_Years  
- Govt_Effectiveness  
- Rule_of_Law  
- Control_of_Corruption  
- Political_Stability  
- Voice_and_Accountability  
- GDP_Per_Capita
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="World Happiness Variables"}
- Year, Rank, Country  
- Happiness_Score  
- Social_support  
- Freedom_to_make_life_choices  
- Generosity  
- Perceptions_of_corruption
:::

I focused on six countries: the United States, and the five highest-ranking countries from the 2024 Happiness Index report 
- Finland
- Denmark
- Iceland
- Sweden
- Netherlands

These countries consistently appeared in all seven years of data and offer a contrast in policy and institutional design.

## Data Collection and Processing

To obtain the [World Bank indicators](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589), I used the World Bank API to fetch up-to-date economic data for each country from 2018-2024. This automated data pull ensured the data is current and realiable allowing me to collect many indicators across multiple years without manual download or entry.

I downloaded the [World Happiness Index Data](https://www.worldhappiness.report/data-sharing/) directly from the website via CSV's from 2020-2024. The data from 2018 and 2019 were downloaded from Kaggle, as it was not offered for download on the World Happiness Report Data Sharing site. However, to ensure validity, I cross referenced and checked every number to match up to the rankings both years on the [World Happiness Report rankings/data](https://data.worldhappiness.report/table), and they did, so I downloaded the csv's for [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/njlow1202/world-happiness-report-data-2018) and [2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anitaannah/world-happiness-report-2019).

I then loaded all this data into a clean, relational SQLite database, making it easy to query and merge across sources.

To manage this data, I built a clean SQLite database and automated a pipeline to extract, transform, and load the information.

The diagram below shows the pipeline I built to collect, process, and analyse this data:

## The U.S. Lags in Happiness, Despite Its Wealth

Despite its high GDP, the U.S. placed **23rd in 2024** in happiness, far behind the top 5 happiest countries.

![](./figures/happiness_over_time.svg){width=60%}

More importantly, the **gap is growing**. The happiest countries continue to sustain or increase their well-being, while the U.S. has trended downward in the rankings.

## Governance Could Predict Happiness Instead of GDP

To figure out what actually drives happiness, I calculated correlations between every World Bank indicator and happiness scores across all countries and years.

![](./figures/correlation_with_happiness.svg){width=60%}

The results show that the strongest correlations of happiness weren't economic, rather they were all about how well countries are governed:

- **Rule of Law** (ρ = 0.93)  
- **Voice and Accountability** (ρ = 0.87)  
- **Control of Corruption** (ρ = 0.83)  
- **Government Effectiveness** (ρ = 0.77)  
- **Political Stability** (ρ = 0.70)

However, economic indicators like GDP and Health Expenditure actually had negative correlations with happiness.
The U.S. underperforms on these governance metrics relative to the happiest countries, which helps explain its lower happiness scores, and what may consistently predict happiness

## Exploring the Indicators vs. Happiness

To explore this further, I built an interactive chart that lets you compare happiness scores against any indicator in the dataset. You can switch the dropdown to governance metrics like Rule of Law or Voice and Accountability, and you’ll see a clear upward trend. Switch to economic metrics like GDP or Health Expenditure, and the pattern often disappears or reverses.

```{python}
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Loaded the cleaned dataset that merged World Bank and Happiness data.
df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/joined_world_bank_happiness.csv")

# Averaged across years to produce a single row per country.
df = df.groupby("Country", as_index=False).mean(numeric_only=True)

# Selected numeric columns to use as x-axis options.
# Excluded variables that were either redundant or not meaningful for comparison.
exclude = ["Rank", "Year", "Population_Total", "Happiness_Score"]
x_vars = [col for col in df.select_dtypes("number").columns if col not in exclude]

# Fixed the y-axis to Happiness Score, which remained constant across views.
y = "Happiness_Score"
x0 = x_vars[0]  # Chose the first variable as the default x-axis.

# Created the scatter plot figure using Plotly.
fig = go.Figure()

# Added a trace that plotted each country as a labeled dot.
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=df[x0],
    y=df[y],
    mode="markers+text",
    text=df["Country"],
    textposition="top center",
    marker=dict(size=10, color="mediumseagreen"),
    name=f"{x0} vs {y}"
))

# Updated the layout to improve readability and fit within the page.
fig.update_layout(

    autosize=True,
    width=900,

    margin=dict(t=100, l=80, r=80, b=80),

    # Changed the camel case formatting
    xaxis=dict(
        title=dict(text=x0.replace("_", " "), standoff=20),
        automargin=True
    ),

    # Made the formatting strong for the y axis label
    yaxis=dict(
        title=dict(text="Happiness Score", standoff=20),
        automargin=True
    ),

    # Added a dropdown menu that allowed users to switch the x-axis variable.
    updatemenus=[{
        "buttons": [

                "method": "update",

                "args": [
                    {"x": [df[x]]},

    }]
)

# Rendered the chart in the Quarto page.
fig.show()
```

This chart helps see the relationship between happiness and all of the indicators collected. What can be conveyed from the chart is how consistently governance metrics outperformed economic ones. Besides government factors, even indicators like Freedom to make life choices and Social support showed stronger patterns than GDP. It made me rethink what development actually means, and how we measure success and happiness.

The four governance indicators with the strongest correlations are shown below:
- Rule of Law
- Voice and Accountability
- Control of Corruption
- Government Effectiveness
Each plot compares happiness scores against governance quality, highlighting how the U.S. stacks up against the happiest countries.

## The U.S. Governance Gap May Explain the Gap in Happiness

Since governance mattered most, I looked at how the U.S. compared to the happiest countries on the four key governance indicators that correlated strongest with happiness.

![](./figures/governance_vs_happiness.svg){width=60%}

The pattern was clear across all four plots. The happiest countries consistently cluster in the upper right, with high governance quality AND high happiness. The U.S., marked in red, sits noticeably lower on both dimensions every time.
It may not be about making and having enough money. Happiness could pertain to whether people trust their institutions, feel like the system is fair, and believe their government actually works for them.

## Conclusion

So why is the U.S. far from the happiest?

It may not fully be about income or spending. It’s about **governance**. The happiest countries in the world aren’t just economically successful, but they’re **well-governed, politically stable, and trusted by their citizens**.

If the U.S. wants to rise in happiness rankings, having a great GDP isn’t enough. It may need to rebuild **public trust, institutional accountability, and effective governance**.

it raises a future question: What if happiness depends less on how much a country earns, and more on how fairly and effectively it is run?
This project shows how public datasets, when combined and analyzed thoughtfully, can reveal the deeper structures behind society's well-being.
