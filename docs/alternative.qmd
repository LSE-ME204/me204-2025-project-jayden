# Overview

This project, completed for [ME204](https://lse-dsi.github.io/ME204/2025/), explores a simple but important question:  
**Why isn't the United States one of the happiest countries in the world — despite being one of the richest?**

Using seven years of global survey data from the World Happiness Reports, along with national indicators from the World Bank API, I built a complete data pipeline to explore what really explains national happiness. The U.S. consistently underperforms in global happiness rankings — and this project investigates why.

::: {.callout-note}
**Key findings:**
- The U.S. ranks far below the happiest nations, and its happiness gap is growing.
- Good governance — not GDP — is the strongest predictor of happiness.
- Global happiness is remarkably stable — and tied to institutional strength.

# Methodology

To investigate this question, I combined two global data sources:

- The **World Happiness Reports** (2018–2024), which rank countries based on average self-reported life satisfaction.
- A selected set of **World Bank indicators**, including governance scores, GDP per capita, life expectancy, and more.

I focused on six countries: the U.S. and the five top-ranking countries in the 2024 report (Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, and the Netherlands). These countries appeared consistently across all seven years of available data.

The full data pipeline — including automated API pulls, cleaning, and database integration — is shown below:

# Findings

## 1. The U.S. Ranks Low in Happiness — and It’s Falling Further

Despite its global economic strength, the U.S. consistently ranks **below** the happiest countries. In 2024, it placed **23rd**, far behind countries like Finland and Denmark — despite having one of the highest GDP per capita values.

This gap isn’t shrinking. If anything, it’s growing: while Nordic countries maintain or improve happiness, the U.S. has seen modest declines.

## 2. Governance Is the Strongest Predictor of Happiness

To explore what really predicts happiness, I calculated the **correlation between World Bank indicators and average national happiness scores**.

The clearest takeaway? **Governance matters most**.

Top positive correlations:
- `Rule of Law` (ρ = 0.93)
- `Voice and Accountability` (ρ = 0.87)
- `Control of Corruption` (ρ = 0.83)
- `Government Effectiveness` (ρ = 0.77)
- `Political Stability` (ρ = 0.70)

By contrast:
- `GDP per Capita`: **ρ = -0.44**
- `Health Expenditure % GDP`: **ρ = -0.88**
- `Social Support`: barely correlated

These results suggest that happiness is not about how much wealth a country produces — but about how well it is governed.

## 3. Global Happiness Is Resilient — Governance May Explain Why

Between 2018 and 2024, global happiness stayed **remarkably stable** — despite events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries with strong institutions — such as rule of law, political stability, and effective governance — appear better equipped to sustain happiness even during crisis. Economic volatility doesn’t necessarily reduce well-being if institutional trust remains high.

# Conclusion

So, why is the U.S. unhappy?

It's not the economy. It’s **the quality of governance**. The happiest countries aren't the richest — they’re the ones where people trust their institutions, feel secure, and experience political stability and accountability.

This project shows that using public data and open tools, we can reveal insights that challenge assumptions. If America wants to be happier, the path may not be more GDP — but better governance.
